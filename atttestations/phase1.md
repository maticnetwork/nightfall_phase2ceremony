According to [this](https://electriccoin.co/blog/reinforcing-the-security-of-the-sapling-mpc/), a
random beacon might not be strictly necessary. For this reason, and since phase2 is to be applied
for each circuit, we decided to not run the random beacon.

After this, the `preparePhase2` process will be run.
